##  Overview

The book-summarizer project aims to automate the process of summarizing books using AI. The main.py file orchestrates the summarization by extracting text from PDFs, generating prompts, and utilizing OpenAI to create summaries based on specified topics. The prompts.py file defines guidelines for expert text summarizers to extract insights from manuscripts. The project's core value lies in efficiently summarizing books, streamlining content digestion, and aiding in knowledge acquisition.
